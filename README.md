**An Agentic System for Scalable Articulated 3D Asset Generation.**

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15187) | [Project Page](https://articraft3d.github.io/)

Articraft transforms the creation of articulated 3D assets into a programmatic, code-generation workflow powered by LLMs. Engineered for large-scale dataset generation, it bypasses heavyweight manual tools to rapidly produce objects with semantic parts, robust geometry, and physical joints.

> **Security Note:** Articraft compiles and inspects generated records by executing their `model.py` files as Python code. Only run generated records and model scripts from trusted sources.

## Quickstart

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 recommended (or 3.11). *Note: 3.13+ is not currently supported.*
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for incredibly fast Python package management.
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as the command runner.
- [`Git LFS`](https://git-lfs.com/) for hydrating dataset records on demand.
- [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (optional, but needed for local viewer frontend).

### 2. Setup
From the repo root, run:
```bash
just setup
```
To set up a checkout from another working directory, pass the repository root:
```bash
just setup ./path/to/checkout
```

Fresh clones are code-first: `data/records/**` is stored with Git LFS and excluded from automatic LFS fetch by `.lfsconfig`, so it does not need to be hydrated before developing the code or browsing indexed metadata. Hydrate records only when you want to inspect, render, or edit their payloads:

```bash
uv run articraft data hydrate --record <record_id>
uv run articraft data hydrate --category <category_slug>
uv run articraft data hydrate --time-from 2026-04-01 --time-to 2026-04-07
uv run articraft data hydrate --last 7d
uv run articraft data hydrate --all
```

### 3. Add API Keys
Open `.env` and set `GEMINI_API_KEYS` (comma-separated for key rotation, or a single key). Gemini is the only supported LLM backend; the Vertex backend works too via `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` / `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` / `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`.

> **No API Keys?** No problem. You can use external AI agents like Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor instead. For Codex setup, including how to add the Codex plugin, see [Codex Plugin Setup](docs/codex_plugin.md). Then point the agent at this repository and prompt it:
> 
> *"Create a realistic articulated [object name] and add it to the Articraft dataset. Follow EXTERNAL_AGENT_DATA.md."*

### 4. Create an Asset

Generate your first model directly from a prompt using `articraft generate`:
```bash
uv run articraft generate "Create a realistic articulated desk lamp with a weighted base, two hinged arms, and an adjustable lamp head."
```

If you specify no overrides, it uses `ARTICRAFT_MODEL` and `ARTICRAFT_THINKING_LEVEL` from `.env` when present, otherwise `--model gemini-3.5-flash --thinking-level high`. You can change models and caps:
```bash
uv run articraft generate --max-cost-usd 1.5 "Create a compact desk fan with adjustable tilt."
```

To generate from a reference image, see [Image-Conditioned Generation](docs/image_conditioned_generation.md).

### 5. Open the Viewer
Browse the objects you just generated. The local viewer API and React frontend can be started with:
```bash
just viewer
```

The viewer can browse/search the dataset from `data/records_index.jsonl` before record payloads are hydrated. When you select an unhydrated record, use the "Hydrate record" action before opening source files, traces, or rendered assets.

### 6. Edit an Existing Asset
Fork an existing record when you want to modify it:
```bash
uv run articraft fork data/records/<record_id> "make the handle longer"
```

Forking creates a new child record and leaves the parent unchanged. See [Editing Existing Records](docs/record_editing.md) for model options, dataset behavior, and history viewing.

## Contribute Data

A huge part of Articraft's mission is crowdsourcing a diverse, massive dataset of articulated 3D models. We welcome generation via our CLI, batch processing, or through external AI agents (like Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor).

For full details on our data pipelines, generation guides, and opening pull requests, please read the complete **[Data Contribution Workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

**Data Usage & Licensing**  
By contributing data to the Articraft project, you acknowledge and agree that your submissions will be used to build, evaluate, and improve machine learning models, and will be distributed publicly as part of our datasets.
